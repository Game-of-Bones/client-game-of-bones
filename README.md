*   [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution.
*   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Declarative routing for React.
*   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework.
*   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
*   [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible, and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

## Main Features of the Application

## Post Management

- **Create and Edit Articles:**  
  The existence of an edit route (`/posts/:id/edit`) and the nature of the application indicate that authorized users (authors/admins) can create and modify posts.

- **Read Articles:**  
  Users can view a list of all posts and click to access a detailed page for each one.

- **Delete Articles:**  
  Thereâ€™s functionality to delete posts, protected by a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.

---

## Detailed Paleontological Data Display

Each post is not just an article, but a technical record that can display:

- **Basic Information:** Title, summary, main content, and featured image.  
- **Discovery Data:** Discovery date, paleontologistâ€™s name, geological period, and location.  
- **Fossil Technical Data:** Type of fossil (bones, shells, amber, etc.) and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

---

## User Management and Authentication

- **Sign Up and Login:**  
  The application includes a system for users to register and log in.

- **Content Association:**  
  Posts are linked to an author, displaying their username.

---

## Content Organization and Navigation

- **Categories and Tags:**  
  The API defines endpoints for `/categories` and `/tags`, which implies users can filter and browse posts using these taxonomies.

---

## User Interactivity

- **Comment System:**  
  The API has an endpoint for `/comments`, indicating that users can read and write comments on posts.

---

## Modern and Responsive User Interface

- **Adaptive Design:**  
  The use of Tailwind CSS suggests that the interface is built to work seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

- **Smooth Experience:**  
  As a Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React and React Router, navigation between pages is fast and does not require a full page reload.
